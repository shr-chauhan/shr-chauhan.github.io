# Work Experience - Detailed Descriptions

## Quantum
At Quantum, I lead the engineering team responsible for the Unified Surveillance Platform (USP), the company’s flagship solution for large-scale video surveillance infrastructure. USP is intelligent software that delivers optimized hyperconverged infrastructure—bringing compute, storage, and networking together into a unified system specifically designed for the demanding requirements of video recording and analytics.

I manage and mentor a 10-member engineering team in India while working closely with Quantum’s US-based storage team to build a tightly integrated compute–storage platform. My role spans engineering leadership, architectural decision-making, and hands-on technical contribution.

I contributed significantly to the initial architecture and core components of USP and continue to drive key areas across system reliability, high availability, orchestration, and performance. I collaborate with cross-functional teams—product, QA, support, and field engineers—to ensure that USP deploys seamlessly across customer environments, from multi-node USP clusters to the single-node SmartNVR appliance.

My responsibilities include defining engineering processes, aligning product priorities with business goals, improving system observability, and ensuring scalable deployments for mission-critical video surveillance workloads. I balance leadership with individual contribution, owning critical components and enabling the team to deliver high-quality, production-ready features.

## Isomeds
Isomeds was not a full-time role; I initially joined to help a former EnCloudEn co-founder who started the company after Quantum retained only the core engineering team. The technology for the e-pharmacy platform had been outsourced, but it faced significant architectural, performance, and operational challenges. I stepped in to support him technically, which gradually evolved into taking full ownership of the platform’s engineering.

I designed and built the entire backend for Isomeds, including the APIs, database models, pricing and recommendation logic, authentication system, and integration with external medicine catalog services. I also contributed to parts of the React frontend and built major components of the Flutter mobile application, including search, OTP authentication, Razorpay integration, and prescription upload workflows.

Beyond writing the product, I shaped the overall technical architecture for the D2C omni-channel model and ensured the platform was scalable, maintainable, and production-ready. The intent was for me to join as a co-founder as the company scaled, but Isomeds was shut down a few months after launch due to business and operational reasons.

Despite the short timeline, Isomeds allowed me to apply full-stack ownership, product thinking, and hands-on engineering to build a complete e-pharmacy platform end-to-end.

## EnCloudEn
At EnCloudEn, I led the engineering organization responsible for building our suite of enterprise products, including our Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) platform, private cloud solution, and VDI offering. I oversaw end-to-end product development—from architecture and design to implementation, deployment, and operational stability—while growing and mentoring a high-performing engineering team.

I played a hands-on role in designing and building the core components of EnCloudEn’s HCI stack, leveraging OpenStack for compute and Ceph for storage. I also contributed heavily to our SPICE-based VDI solution, automation systems, monitoring framework, and the overall cloud management layer. My work spanned distributed systems, virtualization, storage integration, orchestration, performance engineering, and system reliability.

Beyond engineering execution, I collaborated closely with founders, product teams, and customers to define the roadmap and translate real-world needs into scalable, production-ready features. I also streamlined engineering processes, improved release cycles, and established best practices around testing, observability, and deployment automation.

My contributions were instrumental in shaping EnCloudEn’s technology and product direction, ultimately helping position the company for its successful acquisition by Quantum in 2021.
